Great to see:
- Good job sticking to the specification
- It was great to see everyone focusing on the MVP first.
- Liked how many folks answered “Is a model more valuable than the baseline”
- Amazing time management skills, especially w/ everything going on right now
- Slides were easy to follow; designed well and had lots of details
- Glad to hear presenters calling out/raised awareness to errors so there wouldn’t be confusion. Good to see no glossing over.
- Glad to see agenda slides that share your organization and what to expect
- Awesome to see separate models by location or specific subgroups
- Good job making large visualization that take up the entire screen so you
- Good to see annotations on top of the visuals, to call out the takeaways. It’s totally OK to use your presentation tool to add the arrows/annotations
- “These are clearly not beginner or intro level”
Be sure to:
- Lead with your conclusion. Put your conclusions first, then explain the detail, and review conclusions at the end. It makes a sandwich!
- Title your charts
- Label your axes
- Always add an intro slide with your name and what the project is doing. It answers the question “Why are we here” to the audience
- Make both a title slide and an intro slide. You’re hyperaware of what you’re working on, and your audience might not be, so “onboard” them to your project
- Make your numbers easy to consume. You don’t need cents no house value or RMSE of house value. Round to the closest thousand
- Turn tax rate into a percent.
- Explain where your data come from. Where did the extra data (like county/state) come from?
- Give a shape of the data. How many rows/columns?
- Summarize your data prep steps. What did you do with nulls? How did you isolate outliers worth dropping?
- What are the coefficients of your model? What do those really mean? “For every $3 in X, we get $1 in Y”
- Share a roadmap at the beginning of the presentation. Maps allow people to follow you better. They’ll know where you’re going.
- Executive summary slide (takeaways) at the beginning and end.
    - Think of it as, if someone (e.g. an exec) only had time to read one thing, what would you include on it?
    - Basically your summary / conclusion slide, but at the start of the presentation, as opposed to the end.
- Pay attention to your body language :)
Recommendations:
- It’s OK to drop outliers if those observations are not possible or realistic. For example, 0 bed, 0 bath are worth dropping and 20 bedrooms w/ 0 bathrooms is worth dropping.
